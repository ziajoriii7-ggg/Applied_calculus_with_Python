# SymPy Basics
**SymPy is a Python library for working with mathematical expressions in symbolic form**.

We have seen that Python variables must be assigned a value. However, in math, variables are often used to represent unknowns. Symbolic computation allows us to manipulate expressions with variables that are not assigned a value.

Symbolic computation also retains the exact value of expressions, rather than rounding them to decimals. 

The alternative to symbolic computation is numerical computation. In numerical computation, all values are represented as either integers or floating-point numbers.

Throughout this course, we will use SymPy to do calculus  with Python. 
If you are interested in learning more about SymPy, including how to install it locally, you can refer to the [SymPy tutorial](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/index.html)


## Importing from SymPy
To import functions from Python libraries, use the statement from library import names. The statement from library import * imports all names from the library.

To import everything from SymPy, we would use

``from sympy import``
